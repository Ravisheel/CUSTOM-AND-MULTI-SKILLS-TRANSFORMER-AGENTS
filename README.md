# CUSTOM-AND-MULTI-SKILLS-TRANSFORMER-AGENTS

In this project I have developed LangChain Agents from scratch to perform conversation chat with user and perform tasks as asked by users. The agent is proficient in handling complex mathematical tasks and can also fetch the latest information from Google Search and summarize it for the user.

In addition I have also built Transformer agents to interact with Humans to perform tasks such as image generation, captioning, reading text and segmentation. 

More details can be found in .IPYNB file and in google colab. For listening audio please go to google colab to play audios. 

I have also used FlowiseAI application to build the same agents just by Drag & drop UI to build my customized LLM flow. You can view my previous chats with agent in the message.json file
